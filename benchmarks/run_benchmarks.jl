# Create lists of different sizes. For each list size, you'll evaluate two cases:
#  - one where there are at most 10 distinct items (e.g., `list = rand(1:10, n)`)
#  - one where the number of distinct items is half the list length (`list = rand(1:n√∑2, n)`)
# Then run both `unique_2loops` and `unique_set` on both lists, measuring the elapsed time with `@belapsed`
# (from BenchmarkTools.jl). Put the list creation in a `setup` block; you can see a demo in the README for BenchmarkTools.
# Hints:
# - inside a comprehension I would typically use the syntax `@belapsed(<code goes here>, setup=(<setup code>))`
#   to avoid any ambiguity about where the expressions passed to the macro `@belapsed` start and stop.
# - you may have to use `$n` to bring an outside variable into the expression passed to `@belapsed`
