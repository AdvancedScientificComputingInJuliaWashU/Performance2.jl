using Performance2

# Read the source code for `create_hashtable` and `push_hashtable!` in `src/Performance2.jl`.
# (You can read `hash2index` too, although you won't call it directly.)

# For the letters of the alphabet, `'a':'z'`, push each once onto a hashtable that you create
# with `create_hashtable`. Do this four times, for hash tables of size 16, 32, 64, and 128.
# Be sure you look at the result. Then fill in the table in the README with the number of
# collisions you observe for each table size.
